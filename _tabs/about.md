I am an astrophysicist currently wrapping up my PhD degree at the University of Tübingen and soon heading off to work as a postdoc at KTH Stockholm.

My main area of interest concerns neutron stars in X-ray pulsars and their observational properties. I have studied spin reversals in these systems in my [bachelor thesis](https://isaathoff.github.io/posts/bachelor/) and investigated in particular Her X-1 in my [master thesis](https://isaathoff.github.io/posts/master/). In my PhD thesis, I developed a novel approach to try and understand different contributions in pulse profiles from these sources.

For more information, feel free to explore this website (e.g. have a look at my [CV](https://isaathoff.github.io/posts/cv/) and [research interests](https://isaathoff.github.io/posts/science/)) and please do not hesitate to contact me under [saathoff.astro@gmail.com](mailto:saathoff.astro@gmail.com). You can also find me on [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3068-7275).

## How do I create graphics and animations?
In case you were wondering how I create the images and animations on this site, I mostly use:
- Hardware: [iPad Pro 2021](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/) with [Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/) Gen 2
- For drawings and artsy backgrounds: [Procreate](https://procreate.art)
- For vector graphics: [Affinity Designer 2](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/ipad/)
- For animating the drawings or graphics: [Callipeg](https://callipeg.com)
