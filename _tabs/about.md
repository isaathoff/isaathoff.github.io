I am an astrophysicist currently working as a postdoc at KTH Stockholm.

My main interest up to and including my PhD, which I completed at the University of Tübingen, has been neutron stars in X-ray pulsars and their observational properties. I studied spin reversals in these systems in my [bachelor's thesis](https://isaathoff.github.io/posts/bachelor/) and in particular Her X-1 in my [master's thesis](https://isaathoff.github.io/posts/master/). In my PhD thesis I developed a novel approach to understand the different contributions in the pulse profiles of these sources. At KTH I am working with Prof. Josefin Larsson, and I am continuing to analyse X-ray data, but now broadening my horizons to other objects and phenomena such as "Supernova Shock Breakout Emission" and "Pulsar Wind Nebulae".

For more information, feel free to explore this website (e.g. have a look at my [CV](https://isaathoff.github.io/posts/cv/) and [research interests](https://isaathoff.github.io/posts/science/)) and please do not hesitate to contact me under [saathoff@kth](mailto:saathoff@kth.se). You can also find me on [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3068-7275) and my profile page on the KTH Website is [here](https://www.kth.se/profile/saathoff).

## How do I create graphics and animations?
In case you were wondering how I create the images and animations on this site, I mostly use:
- Hardware: [iPad Pro 2021](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/) with [Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/) Gen 2
- For drawings and artsy backgrounds: [Procreate](https://procreate.art)
- For vector graphics: [Affinity Designer 2](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/ipad/)
- For animating the drawings or graphics: [Callipeg](https://callipeg.com)
