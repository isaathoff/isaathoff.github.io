I'm an astrophysicist currently wrapping up my PhD degree at the University of Tübingen.

My main area of interest concerns neutron stars in X-ray pulsars and their observational properties. I have studied spin reversals in these systems in my bachelor thesis and investigated in particular Her X-1 in my master thesis. In my PhD thesis, I will use a novel approach to try and understand different contributions in pulse profiles from these sources.
