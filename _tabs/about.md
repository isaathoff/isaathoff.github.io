I am an astrophysicist currently working as a postdoc at KTH Stockholm.

My main interests up to and including my PhD, which I completed at the University of Tübingen, have been neutron stars as X-ray pulsars and their observational properties. I studied spin reversals in these systems in my [bachelor's thesis](https://isaathoff.github.io/posts/bachelor/) and in particular Her X-1 in my [master's thesis](https://isaathoff.github.io/posts/master/). In my PhD thesis I developed a novel approach to understand the different contributions in the pulse profiles of these sources. At KTH I am working with Prof. Josefin Larsson, and I am continuing to analyse X-ray data, but now broadening my horizons to other objects and phenomena such as "Supernova Shock Breakout Emission" and "Pulsar Wind Nebulae". For more information on my science interests see [Science - Research Interests](https://isaathoff.github.io/posts/science/) and for some public outreach projects see [Public Outreach](https://isaathoff.github.io/categories/public-outreach/). You can find my ORCiD [here](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3068-7275).

## How do I create graphics and animations?
In case you were wondering how I create the images and animations on this site, I mostly use:
- Hardware: [iPad Pro 2021](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/) with [Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/) Gen 2
- For drawings and artsy backgrounds: [Procreate](https://procreate.art)
- For vector graphics: [Affinity Designer 2](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/ipad/)
- For animating the drawings or graphics: [Callipeg](https://callipeg.com)
