As part of "Forskarlovet at Tekniska museet Oct 31 - Nov 2" (engl. "Research Holidays at the Museum of Technology"), a group of researchers from the Department of Astronomy at Stockholm University and from Particle and Astroparticle Physics at KTH - including me - got together and took shifts at the museum to do some public outreach and talk to visitors - adults and children alike. I made a little film, which you can see above and [here](/img/20231031-Tekniska.gif) as an illustration. Some of the images and other movies in this film come from these sources:

It was a fun event and a great way to talk about what researchers do and encourage the children to stay curious!
