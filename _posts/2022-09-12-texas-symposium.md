I participated at the 31st Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics which was held in Prague, Czech Republic, in September 2022. The conference website can be found [here](https://texas2021.org). I contributed to the conference with a talk on my PhD project on disentangeling the flux contributions to the pulse profiles of accreting X-ray pulsars. The ADS entry can be seen [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022tsra.confE.120S/abstract) and you can find the slides of the talk below.
