I am trying to learn Swedish and have recently spent some time creating Pingi, a penguin. It's a fun little project. This is probably not the best way to view the files, but the idea is to fill in the blanks, and the following page shows the correct solution. 

<object data="/img/20240309-Pingi-Swedish-Backflip.pdf" width="540px" height="960px">
    <embed src="/img/20240309-Pingi-Swedish-Backflip.pdf">
    </embed>
</object>

I have also created the same story in German. In this example, there are no spaces to fill in, but the story is in both English and German:

<object data="/img/20240309-Pingi-German-Backflip.pdf" width="540px" height="960px">
