I participated at the third scientific conference dedicated to the Athena X-ray Observatory on "Exploring the Hot and Energetic Universe". It was held in Barcelona, Spain, in November 2022. The conference website can be found [here](https://indico.ifca.es/event/2518/). I contributed to the conference with a poster on my PhD project on disentangeling the flux contributions to the pulse profiles of accreting X-ray pulsars. [Here](https://zenodo.org/record/7228995#.Y2uSDy-B3Rb) you can find the Zenodo link with the poster.
